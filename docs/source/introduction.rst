Introduction
============

Humanitarians are increasingly recognizing that anticipating
the risk of a disaster can be more effective than traditional
emergency response. To reduce the vulnerability and exposure
of affected populations, the underlying hazard risk
must be identified and understood.

This is where OCHA AnticiPy comes in. Gaining the understanding of hazard risk
requires in-depth analysis of decades of historical data relating to
the shock of interest as well as any related indicators.
The goal of OCHA AnticiPy is to to
simplify the downloading and processing of
data related to the anticipation of humanitarian risk.

Datasets currently supported are:

- CHIRPS rainfall
- COD ABs (Common Operational Datasets administrative boundaries)
- FEWS NET food insecurity
- GloFAS river discharge
- IRI seasonal rainfall forecast
- USGS NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index)

At the `Centre for Humanitarian Data <https://centre.humdata.org/>`_,
we've now used OCHA Anticipy to develop
some of our own
`anticipatory action
<https://www.unocha.org/our-work/humanitarian-financing/anticipatory-action>`_
frameworks, such as for
`drought in Burkina Faso
<https://github.com/OCHA-DAP/pa-aa-bfa-drought>`_.
